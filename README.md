CloudTalk Integration 
Project Status: Under Development
This module is currently in an experimental development phase. The integration is incomplete, so it is normal to find files, links, or functions that do not lead anywhere or are not yet functional.

Network Configuration
The system uses the following ports for communication:

Database Connection: Port 5432

Backend Service: Port 8080

Language Support
Currently, the system is only available in English. Support for Spanish is planned for the near future, and we are considering adding more languages in later stages, as could be an Angular interface! 

Installation and Execution
To ensure the environment functions correctly, the following steps are required:

Start the corresponding container.

Install NPM and all necessary dependencies for Maven and Spring Boot.

Run the project's .java file.

Disclaimer
As this is a development build, the software is provided "as is." The developers are not responsible for connectivity issues or missing components. Use is recommended only in controlled testing environments.
